= Q. How to use font-awesome icons? =
You can input a normal html code for example:
    "&lt;i class="fa fa-shopping-cart"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Buy Now"
in the text box and it will work like a charm.

But remember this plugin does not add the font-awesome icons or any other icon sets. Your theme must load the necessary icons/fonts. So, if an icon is not available, you may manually add it to the theme and then use it.
